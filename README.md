An application that allows you to login your classes automatically in Sakai.

## Tech Stack
- [Electron.js] - Electron.js was the main layer which connects Frontend and automations since we can use any Node.js packages inside the main process.
- [React.js] - React.js was used as the main Frontend framework.
- [TailwindCSS] - I could say it just makes the development way faster.
- [Selenium] - I prefered Selenium WebDriver to manipulate browser (mainly to get/join classes).
